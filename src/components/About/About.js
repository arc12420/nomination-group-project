        <h2>About The Ivory Foundation</h2>
        <p>The Ivory Foundation is working with local communities to empower people to serve others. The foundation enables members of the community access to service projects.

            Back in 2004 our founder JANE Dev, was blessed to be able to go with many others to assist in providing aid to the people of Haiti immediately following hurricane Ike. She was completely astounded at the number of volunteers that had traveled to render aid but even more than that, she was humbled to see the people of Haiti serving each other. “Even after all they had been through and all that they had lost, they were there to help each other.” - JANE Dev

              Our non-profit organizations core motivation stems from the quote “Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.” - Howard Zinn
